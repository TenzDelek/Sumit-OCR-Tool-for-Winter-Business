# Inspiration

This tool is designed specifically for `Tibetan` Winter Business Sellers, aiming to alleviate the cumbersome process of manual calculations from their books. The inspiration for this tool struck me when I witnessed my father spending countless hours grappling with the complexities of calculating `Bhulon and Mar Tsa`, often under considerable stress. Seeing his struggle sparked the idea to develop a solution that `streamlines these calculations`, saving time and reducing the burden for business owners like him with just one simple click.
